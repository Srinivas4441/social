    <p><strong>What will the output display?</strong></p>
    <p>The output of the analysis will display:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A summary of the prediction results, including the mean squared error and RÂ² score, which indicate the accuracy of the prediction model.</li>
        <li>A visual comparison of the actual vs. predicted daily usage time for the selected platform, displayed as a bar chart.</li>
    </ul>
